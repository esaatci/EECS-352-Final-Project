NEXT STEPS:

1) Incorporating note length as a feature input to the model

2) Train the model using different parameters and save how the accuracy improves while the loss
   decreases over various epochs.

   -Train the model using different (Dropout, BatchSize, NumSteps, SkipSize)
   -For each training, create an array for accuracy and loss and plot them at the end

3) Generate 10 examples and take the best ones to showcase on the website

4) Make sure Aaron does a good job building the website and creating the poster

5) Compare output from LSTM to output from MusicBox and let people vote which one it sounds
   closer to (A:folk or B:music)

6) Discuss results, evaluate your model, check all the boxes from the Final Project PDF
